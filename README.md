Step 1: How to use Visual Studio Code instead of Visual Studio (e.g., by installing C# and the C# Dev Kit in Visual Studio Code) : https://youtu.be/ZVGutgqBMUM?si=POZ_w76qPnEkbgvI

üß∞ My Development Stack

‚Ä¢	Code Editor: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

‚Ä¢	Database: SQL Server running inside a Docker container

‚Ä¢	Database Management Tool: Azure Data Studio

‚Ä¢	Operating System: macOS




üîÑ Differences from the Tutorial

The original tutorial used:

‚Ä¢	Visual Studio (Windows)

‚Ä¢	SQL Server 2022 Express Edition

‚Ä¢	SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)




In contrast, I used:

‚Ä¢	VS Code instead of Visual Studio

‚Ä¢	SQL Server in Docker instead of Microsoft SQL Server 2022 Express

‚Ä¢	Azure Data Studio instead of SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)




üìÅ What I‚Äôve Completed

‚Ä¢	Built a REST API with CRUD functionality

‚Ä¢	Connected the API to SQL Server via Docker

‚Ä¢	Verified that all database changes made through the API are reflected in Azure Data Studio

‚Ä¢	Successfully ran and tested the project on macOS

‚Ä¢	A screenshot was captured showing the output of Azure Data Studio running on macOS
